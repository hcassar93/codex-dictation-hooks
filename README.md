# Codex Dictation Hooks

Automation hooks for Codex dictation on macOS with launchd. Watch new transcripts and run local actions automatically.

## What it does

Codex stores global dictation history at:

```text
~/.codex/transcription-history.jsonl
```

This tool watches that file for new JSONL entries and runs an action whenever a new transcript appears. The default action sends the newest transcript to the active macOS text buffer.

## Screenshots

Native macOS HUD previews for the hook processing state, word tally counter, and status notice:

</p>

## Install

Clone the repo and run:

```zsh
./bin/codex-dictation-hooks install
```

The installer copies the script to `~/.local/bin/codex-dictation-hooks`, creates a LaunchAgent at:

```text
~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.hcassar93.codex-dictation-hooks.plist
```

and starts it immediately.

## Test in the foreground

```zsh
./bin/codex-dictation-hooks watch
```

Then trigger a new Codex global dictation. You should see a log line when the new transcript is handled.

## Commands

```zsh
./bin/codex-dictation-hooks watch       # watch the history file
./bin/codex-dictation-hooks install     # install and start at login
./bin/codex-dictation-hooks uninstall   # stop and remove the LaunchAgent
./bin/codex-dictation-hooks status      # show LaunchAgent status
./bin/codex-dictation-hooks latest      # run the default action for the latest existing dictation
./bin/codex-dictation-hooks tally       # show tracked word totals
./bin/codex-dictation-hooks import-tally 25000
```

## Configuration

Override the history file if needed:

```zsh
CODEX_DICTATION_HISTORY=/path/to/transcription-history.jsonl ./bin/codex-dictation-hooks watch
```

Run a custom action instead of the default pasteboard action:

```zsh
CODEX_DICTATION_ACTION="/path/to/your-action" ./bin/codex-dictation-hooks watch
```

The transcript is passed to the action on standard input, so the action can format, rewrite, route, or store it.

When a deterministic hook runs, a small native macOS processing HUD appears until the agent returns. Set `"showHud": false` in your hooks config, or run with `CODEX_DICTATION_HUD=0`, to disable it.

When a flag phrase matches, the helper intercepts Codex's pending paste before the raw transcript reaches the focused field, then starts inference. When inference finishes, its result is copied to the pasteboard and pasted if the same application is still frontmost, matching Codex's native Command-V behavior. The raw transcript is never inserted and there is no undo step. With no flag phrase, Codex's normal immediate insertion is left alone. With no focused field, the paste is a no-op and the result stays on the clipboard. If focus moves to another application during inference, the helper does not paste there and leaves the result on the clipboard. Set `"suppressNativeDictationOnHook": false` to disable this behavior.

## Word Tally

The watcher counts words from each new transcript and stores the tally at:

```text
~/.config/codex-dictation-hooks/stats.json
```

After each handled transcript, a small native HUD flashes word-count feedback in the bottom-right corner.

View the tally:

```zsh
./bin/codex-dictation-hooks tally
```

Import a starting baseline from another system:

```zsh
./bin/codex-dictation-hooks import-tally 25000
```

Override the stats file if needed:

```zsh
CODEX_DICTATION_STATS=/path/to/stats.json ./bin/codex-dictation-hooks watch
```

Configure how tally notices appear in your hooks config:

```json
{
  "tallyHud": {
    "mode": "sequence",
    "addedSeconds": 3,
    "totalSeconds": 5,
    "combinedSeconds": 5
  }
}
```

Modes:

- `"sequence"` or `"separate"` shows `Added N words`, then the total.
- `"combined"` shows both values in one slightly wider tally pill.
- `"total"` only shows the total.
- `"off"` hides tally notices.

## Deterministic Agent Hooks

Create a local hooks file in the repo:

```zsh
cp config/hooks.example.json config/hooks.json
```

`config/hooks.json` is ignored by git. Each hook has deterministic trigger phrases and a prompt template:

```json
{
  "agentCommand": "pi -p --no-tools --no-session --model {{model}}",
  "defaultModel": "openai-codex/gpt-5.6-terra:low",
  "hooks": [
    {
      "name": "email",
      "phrases": ["email", "draft email"],
      "prompt": "Rewrite this as a clear email draft. Return only the rewritten text.\n\n{{text}}"
    }
  ]
}
```

Matching is case-insensitive, and the first matching hook wins. Put higher-priority hooks first in the array. If a phrase matches and the configured agent command is installed, the transcript is rewritten before the action runs. If there is no matching hook, no config file, no agent command, or the agent fails, the original transcript is used unchanged.

Single-word phrases match whole words, so a trigger such as `execute` will not match unrelated words such as `executive`. Multi-word phrases use case-insensitive phrase inclusion.

The agent command receives the rendered prompt on standard input. Its standard output becomes the replacement transcript.

Models can be configured globally with `defaultModel` or per hook with `model`. The selected model is available as:

- `{{model}}` in `agentCommand`
- `{{model}}` in `prompt`
- `CODEX_DICTATION_MODEL` in the agent command environment

If your agent command does not include `{{model}}`, you can also set `modelArgument`, for example:

```json
{
  "agentCommand": "pi",
  "defaultModel": "openai-codex/gpt-5.6-terra:low",
  "modelArgument": "-p --no-tools --model {{model}}",
  "hooks": []
}
```

You can also point at a different config:

```zsh
CODEX_DICTATION_HOOKS_CONFIG=/path/to/hooks.json ./bin/codex-dictation-hooks watch
```
